>>Eror-handling:
In 80's and 90's some softwares crashes due to wrong input from users, softwares                    did'nt understand the input from users and it gives erors in code and application               should be crashes, so deveolpers of that think that we have to do some thing in code             that controls the eror in code pass something unique in output.
>Erors in python:                                                                                   1.syntaxeror: when we write some wrong method in code like don't close any bracket means when we write data against the rules of python then passes syntax eror in output.                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. runtime eror: when we write accurate syntax but when we get impossible work from python or something that is not exsist then it passes run time eror like when we devide from 0 because devide a number from zero is impossible then it passes run time eror and when we do indexing and we write an index that is not exisist in that squence data because something is not exisist so it passes run time eror.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3. logical eror: when we write accurate syntax and accurate work but it gives a diferent output means it gives something different sometimes we can easily fix other erors but logical erors but logical are very it not eror indicate the line whre we do eror gives wrong output.  
>simple conclusion points:
1. syntax erors when we write something wrong in code means data against rules/syntax of python.
2. when we write accurate syntax but we get work from python is not possible then it passes run time eorors.
3. when we write possible work with accurate syntax but something that we don't want to get in out put means mistake inside our work then it does not pass any eror but gives wrong out so when writting we have to keep in mind that from that code what python return. 
>exception:
when we do run time eror then it passes a exception in runtime means our wholecode is accurate but something that is unexpected , also from input of user it should be unexpected/impossible then it gives something that is said to be expcetion.

>>Eror handling:
>try and except:
like if-else indented block, For erors we have try-except idented block, In try we have to write that syntax that you have to sure that it gives eror and in except we can print a custom line that we want to pass in output and we can 3-4 expect blocks and mention specific eror and print statement for that eror and this is a good method using this our program should not be crashed.
>else:
we can pass a statement in else block in that we have to write statement if our our code has no any eror then it runs that statement.
>finally:
In finally block we have to write that if our code has erors or not erors but finally statement should be run in any situation.

>custom erors:
we can make our custom eror we have to just make class and we have to give custom name to that we want for eror and in parenthesis write exception and pass after that we can have write raise , that eror name and in parenthesis we have to wite that we want to give custom exception exception.
>key points for making custom eror:
1. Class eror_name(Exception) inside you can write pass or any thing you want.
2. write raise eror_name(Exception) where you need using try-except.
3. when you are writting eror_name is custom you want and when you are writting raise in any except block then you have writting that class name and you can pass custom Exception.
